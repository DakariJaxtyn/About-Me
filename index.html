                <p>Hello, my name is Dakari Jaxtyn. It isn't my real name but it is my online persona. I was born in December, making me a sagittarius. I am bellow the average height due to my mother being small. I am 15 years old and live in Auckland, New Zealand. I moved here in November 2021 from England, where I grew up. I grew up in Reading, England since I was 3 years old. I went to a primary school there for 7 years then I went to an all girls secondary school for three years. Now I am going to a mixed school in Auckland. </p>

            <p class="section-text"> My favourite anime characters are people who have a strong personality so I often don't enjoy or think anything much of main characters. My favourite characters are usually minor villains, side-characters or the main character's best friend. I enjoy morally grey characters because they are believable and flawed. </p>

        <section id="art">
            <h2>Art</h2>
            <p class="section-text">I have always enjoyed looking at art, especially people that are drawn in unique ways, and I practice drawing often so I can achieve an art style that impresses myself. At the age of 10 I was still using dots as eyes and circles as noses but practising constantly has allowed me to improve at a steady pace. I started drawing with the intention to become good at art at the beginning of lockdown when I had nothing else to do. In the time period between the beginning of lockdown and when I am writing this, my art has gotten rapidly better. I am now happy with how I can shade, draw side angles, eyes and hair. However I want to improve at drawing people full-body and different poses and realstic clothing. I enjoy to draw fanart of characters and celebrities and viewing other's fanart on instagram and pinterest.</p>

            <p class="section-text">I spend a lot of my time listening to music. 
                My taste in music is pop-rock. I like songs with meaningful 
                lyrics and a catchy beat. I love soft voices and when the overall 
                song sounds fast-paced. I cannot play any instruments, although 
                I memories a few anime intro songs on the keyboard, could play 
                twinkle twinkle little star on the violin and I could play the 
                background music for a song on the guitar. Some of my favourite 
                singers are Lana Del Rey, Mother Mother, Mitski, Lady Gaga, 
                Nirvana, Billie Eilish and Melanie Martinez.</p>

            <p class="section-text">I have been playing minecraft since I was about 8 and since then there has been many additions to the game. When I first started playing minecraft I didn't see the point in using armor or weapons so I often died. This caused me to use creative mode a lot instead of survival. It wasn't until recently that I started seriously playing minecraft, building buildings and collecting items. I enjoy minecraft streamers such as dream smp streamers like Tommyinnit and Wilbur Soot. They have engaging plot and I feel like they inspired many people to pick up minecraft like me. </p>
